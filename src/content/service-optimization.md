## Case Study: E-commerce Performance Optimization

**Client Challenge**: An e-commerce site was experiencing slow page loads, especially on mobile devices, leading to high abandon rates and poor conversion.

**Solution**: I implemented a comprehensive optimization strategy:
- Implemented code splitting and lazy loading for non-critical components
- Optimized image loading with WebP format and responsive sizing
- Added server-side rendering for product pages
- Refactored state management to reduce unnecessary renders
- Implemented service worker for offline capabilities and caching

**Result**: The client saw a 68% improvement in page load time, 35% reduction in bounce rate, and 22% increase in conversion rate, directly impacting their bottom line.
