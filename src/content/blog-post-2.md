# State Management in 2025: Beyond Redux

State management remains one of the most critical aspects of building React applications. While Redux has been the de facto standard for years, the React ecosystem has evolved significantly. As someone who has implemented state management solutions for dozens of client projects, I've seen firsthand how the landscape has changed.

In this article, I'll explore the modern alternatives to Redux that I'm implementing for clients in 2025, when to use each one, and how to choose the right solution for your specific needs.

## The Evolution of State Management in React

When I started building React applications, the state management story looked quite different:

- **2015-2018**: Redux dominated the ecosystem, becoming almost synonymous with React state management
- **2018-2020**: Context API and useReducer emerged as built-in alternatives
- **2020-2022**: Simpler libraries like Zustand and Recoil gained traction
- **2022-2025**: Atomic state management with Jotai and server state solutions like React Query have become mainstream

This evolution reflects a broader trend toward simplicity, composability, and specialization. Today's React developers have more options than ever, allowing for more targeted solutions to specific state management challenges.

## When to Use (and Not Use) Redux in 2025

Despite newer alternatives, Redux remains relevant for specific use cases. I still recommend Redux for:

- Large enterprise applications with complex state logic
- Teams with existing Redux expertise and infrastructure
- Applications requiring robust dev tools and a mature ecosystem
- Projects where strong conventions and a proven architecture are priorities

However, for many applications, Redux introduces unnecessary complexity. I generally advise against Redux when:

- You're building a small to medium-sized application
- Your state management needs are relatively simple
- You have many independent state slices without complex interactions
- Your team is new to React and facing a steep learning curve

A client recently asked me to refactor their application from Redux to a simpler solution. Their 12,000-line Redux codebase was reduced to about 2,000 lines using more modern approaches, while improving performance and developer productivity.

## Modern Alternatives I Recommend

### 1. Built-in React Solutions: Context + useReducer

For many applications, React's built-in state management capabilities are sufficient.

```jsx
// Create a context
const CounterContext = createContext();

// Create a reducer
function counterReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      throw new Error(`Unsupported action: ${action.type}`);
  }
}

// Create a provider
function CounterProvider({ children }) {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(counterReducer, { count: 0 });
  
  return (
    <CounterContext.Provider value={{ state, dispatch }}>
      {children}
    </CounterContext.Provider>
  );
}

// Custom hook for consumers
function useCounter() {
  const context = useContext(CounterContext);
  if (context === undefined) {
    throw new Error('useCounter must be used within a CounterProvider');
  }
  return context;
}

// Usage in components
function Counter() {
  const { state, dispatch } = useCounter();
  
  return (
    <div>
      Count: {state.count}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>-</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Best for:**
- Small to medium applications
- Teams already familiar with React
- When you want to avoid additional dependencies
- Applications with naturally hierarchical state

**Limitations:**
- Performance issues with large state objects or frequent updates
- Potential for "prop drilling" or excessive context providers
- No built-in developer tools
- No persistence or middleware capabilities out of the box

### 2. Zustand: Simple Yet Powerful

[Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) has become my go-to recommendation for most client projects. It offers Redux-like state management with a fraction of the boilerplate.

```jsx
import create from 'zustand';

// Create a store
const useStore = create((set) => ({
  bears: 0,
  increasePopulation: () => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + 1 })),
  removeAllBears: () => set({ bears: 0 }),
}));

// Use in components
function BearCounter() {
  const bears = useStore((state) => state.bears);
  return <h1>{bears} around here...</h1>;
}

function Controls() {
  const increasePopulation = useStore((state) => state.increasePopulation);
  return <button onClick={increasePopulation}>Add bear</button>;
}
```

**Best for:**
- Medium-sized applications
- Teams transitioning from Redux who want something simpler
- When you need Redux-like capabilities without the boilerplate
- Applications that require middleware or persist capabilities

**Limitations:**
- Less structured than Redux (more flexibility but fewer guardrails)
- Smaller ecosystem compared to Redux
- Less suitable for very complex state interactions

### 3. Jotai: Atomic State Management

For applications with frequently changing UI state, [Jotai](https://jotai.org/) offers an atomic approach that can significantly improve performance.

```jsx
import { atom, useAtom } from 'jotai';

// Create atoms
const countAtom = atom(0);
const doubleCountAtom = atom((get) => get(countAtom) * 2);

// Use in components
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useAtom(countAtom);
  const [doubleCount] = useAtom(doubleCountAtom);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <h2>Double: {doubleCount}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(c => c + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Best for:**
- Applications with many small, independent pieces of state
- UIs with frequent updates to different parts of the state
- When you need fine-grained reactivity
- Applications where performance is critical

**Limitations:**
- Different mental model that may require adjustment
- Can become harder to manage with complex state dependencies
- Relatively new compared to more established solutions

### 4. TanStack Query (React Query): Server State Management

One of the biggest paradigm shifts I've observed is separating client and server state. [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) (formerly React Query) has become the standard solution for managing server state.

```jsx
import { useQuery, useMutation, useQueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import axios from 'axios';

// API functions
const fetchTodos = async () => {
  const { data } = await axios.get('/api/todos');
  return data;
};

const addTodo = async (text) => {
  const { data } = await axios.post('/api/todos', { text, completed: false });
  return data;
};

// Component with React Query
function Todos() {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  
  // Query for fetching todos
  const { data: todos, isLoading, error } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['todos'],
    queryFn: fetchTodos,
  });
  
  // Mutation for adding a todo
  const addMutation = useMutation({
    mutationFn: addTodo,
    onSuccess: () => {
      // Invalidate and refetch
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['todos'] });
    },
  });
  
  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;
  
  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {todos.map(todo => (
          <li key={todo.id}>{todo.text}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          const text = prompt('Enter todo text:');
          if (text) addMutation.mutate(text);
        }}
      >
        Add Todo
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Best for:**
- Applications with significant server interaction
- When you need caching, background updates, and optimistic UI
- Managing resources with a lifecycle (loading, error, success states)
- Reducing unnecessary data fetching

**Limitations:**
- Primarily focused on server state, not client-only state
- Requires a different mental model than traditional state management
- May require additional solutions for client-only state

## Real-world Combinations I Use for Clients

In practice, I often recommend combining these approaches:

1. **TanStack Query + Zustand**
   - TanStack Query for all server state (API calls, data fetching)
   - Zustand for global UI state and client-only business logic

2. **TanStack Query + Context + useState**
   - TanStack Query for server state
   - Context for theme, authentication, and other app-wide concerns
   - useState for component-local state

3. **Jotai + TanStack Query**
   - Jotai for UI state that needs fine-grained updates
   - TanStack Query for server state

## Decision Framework: Choosing the Right Solution

When advising clients on state management, I use this decision framework:

1. **Start with local state**: Use `useState` and `useReducer` for component-specific state
2. **Consider composition**: Can you solve this by lifting state up or using compound components?
3. **Add TanStack Query**: For any server-related state
4. **Evaluate remaining global state needs**:
   - Small app with simple state? Context + useReducer
   - Medium app or need more capabilities? Zustand
   - Complex reactivity needs? Jotai
   - Enterprise app with complex state interactions? Redux Toolkit

5. **Measure performance**: Use React DevTools profiler to identify and address performance issues

## Implementation Strategies

When implementing state management for clients, I follow these best practices:

### Modular State Design

Organize state by domain rather than by data type:

```jsx
// ❌ Bad: Organizing by data type
const store = {
  users: { ... },
  products: { ... },
  orders: { ... }
}

// ✅ Good: Organizing by feature domain
const authStore = { ... }
const productCatalogStore = { ... }
const shoppingCartStore = { ... }
```

### State Colocation

Keep state as close as possible to where it's used:

```jsx
// ❌ Bad: Everything in global state
const useGlobalStore = create((set) => ({
  username: '',
  isDialogOpen: false,
  selectedItem: null,
  // ...dozens more unrelated items
}));

// ✅ Good: Only truly global state in global store
const useAuthStore = create((set) => ({
  user: null,
  login: async (credentials) => { /* ... */ },
  logout: () => { /* ... */ },
}));

// Component-local state stays in the component
function Dialog() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
  // ...
}
```

### State Normalization

For complex relational data, normalize your state:

```jsx
// ❌ Bad: Nested, duplicated data
const state = {
  posts: [
    {
      id: 1,
      title: 'First Post',
      author: { id: 1, name: 'Jon', avatar: '...' },
      comments: [
        { id: 1, text: 'Great post!', author: { id: 2, name: 'Jane', avatar: '...' } }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

// ✅ Good: Normalized data
const state = {
  posts: {
    byId: {
      1: { id: 1, title: 'First Post', authorId: 1, commentIds: [1] }
    },
    allIds: [1]
  },
  users: {
    byId: {
      1: { id: 1, name: 'Jon', avatar: '...' },
      2: { id: 2, name: 'Jane', avatar: '...' }
    },
    allIds: [1, 2]
  },
  comments: {
    byId: {
      1: { id: 1, text: 'Great post!', authorId: 2, postId: 1 }
    },
    allIds: [1]
  }
}
```

## Case Study: Migrating from Redux to Modern Solutions

A recent client came to me with a complex Redux application that had grown unwieldy over time. The codebase had:

- 30+ reducers
- 200+ action types
- Multiple middleware configurations
- Performance issues with large state updates

We migrated to a combined approach:

1. **Server state**: Moved all API calls to TanStack Query
2. **Global UI state**: Migrated to Zustand
3. **Complex form state**: Used Formik with local state
4. **Authentication**: Kept in a specialized Zustand store

The results were impressive:
- 40% reduction in bundle size
- 60% faster state updates
- 70% less boilerplate code
- Happier developers with simpler mental models

## Conclusion

The React state management landscape in 2025 offers more choices than ever, allowing for more tailored solutions to specific problems. For most applications I build today, I recommend:

1. **TanStack Query** for server state
2. **Zustand** for global client state
3. **Context API** for theme/locale/auth state
4. **useState/useReducer** for component-local state

While Redux still has its place in the ecosystem, the trend toward simpler, more specialized state management solutions has made React development more accessible and maintainable.
